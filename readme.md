This is the code and data to reproduce Mahood & Balch (in review). The file make_manuscript.R reproduces the entire manuscript with figures, tables and suppelement. FF_figs.R and tables.R have all of the analysis. Sometimes there were glitchy things I couldn't figure out with Rmarkdown with the tables, so there are sections where the actual code to generate the tables is commented out, and the code to just make the table is pasted in. In those cases, the code does actually work, it just was not knitting right at the very end, so you can uncomment it and run it if you like. If you just run the whole script, the scripts are set up to automatically instally any packages it needs, so maybe it will just work for you. Maybe not though.

the fire frequency map it too big for github, so for now I have it on google drive with a public link.

Download it and put it in the Data folder, and that will make the map figure work.
